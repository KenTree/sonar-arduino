# 🛰️ Sonar Scanner

An **Arduino-based sonar scanning system** that uses an ultrasonic sensor and a micro servo motor to detect and measure the distance of surrounding objects. The servo rotates the ultrasonic sensor, allowing the system to perform a scanning motion and map nearby objects in real time.

## ⚙️ Overview

The **Sonar Scanner** integrates multiple Arduino components:
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)** – Measures distance by sending and receiving sound pulses.
- **Micro Servo (SG90)** – Rotates the ultrasonic sensor to scan across a defined angle.
- **Arduino UNO** – Controls sensor timing, servo movement, and serial communication.
- **External Power Supply** – Provides stable voltage and ensures common grounding across components.

This project demonstrates key embedded programming concepts, including:
- Digital I/O configuration  
- Signal timing and pulse measurement  
- Servo motor control  
- Circuit design and power management  
- Serial monitoring and user input control
